<p>Among the 2016 presidential election polls provided this week, letter grades were designated to disclose their reliability. The most common poll grades were A-, B, and C-, respectively.</p>

In 2020, the most common letter grades for the polls provided was overwhelmingly C, with a distant second of B/C. The letters grades are significantly lower graded than in 2016, and the distribution is left skewed.

The grading scheme changes for 2024 to a 1-3 scale with 3 being the highest rating. There's a heavy emphasis on the higher score between the 2 and 3 range.

The graph above tracks poll approval ratings for Trump and Clinton for about one year before election day. There a few notable trends in this chart. For starters, there is a drastic dip in December 2015 for Trump. This sink in polls can likely be attributed to Trump calling for a complete shutdown on Muslim people entering the United States seeking refuge or citizenship. Additionally, before February 2016, the candidates followed each other in poll approval, meaning they rose and sunk together. Afterwards, their votes began to diverge, so when Clinton did well, Trump did not, and vice versa. This is because the party primaries began in 2016, so both parties had great division between nominees. The Republicans lost a more moderate Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, while the democrats lost a more progressive Bernie Sanders.

The 2020 poll approval chart does not display extreme dips and peaks like in 2016. There is a similar trend that follows before and after the primaries, but not as drastically, since there were no major candidates running against Trump in 2020. The polls find their predictions converge near election day, unlike in 2016 as well. Between April and July, Trump struggled to consistently raise his approval, as the COVID-19 pandemic was endangering millions of Americans everyday. George Floyd's death in May also sparked the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement, which the former President had been unable to empathize with or address, explaining his low rating.

The chaos of 2024's polls represents the chaos that has undergone politics over the past year. The blue line represents President Biden's polls until July 21, 2024 when he drops out of the race and endorses Kamala Harris. Trump and Biden generally matched each other, staying between the 40-45% approval range. However, after a disastrous first debate at the end of June, Biden's polls sink to 35%. Immediately after he drops out in July, the Democratic Party jolts upwards and continues to have a comfortable lead above Trump, despite the age of Harris' campaign, especially following the Democratic National Convention.
