      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poll Ratings Grade Distribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Among the 2016 presidential election polls provided this week, letter grades were designated to disclose their reliability. The most common poll grades were A-, B, and C-, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the most common letter grades for the polls provided was overwhelmingly C, with a distant second of B/C. The letters grades are significantly lower graded than in 2016, and the distribution is left skewed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Blog #2: Economic Predictors</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;An incumbent president running for re-election reaps both benefits and barriers. For one, they are a candidate that the American people are familiar with and normalized to. That being said, the American people also have four years of work to analyze and interpret. The condition of the United States is put on the sitting Commander-in-Chief who is already in the position to lead the economy, culture, and social circumstances of their country. In the past decade, we&amp;rsquo;ve seen Former President Barack Obama benefit in his re-election campaign against Mitt Romney, having been in a post-Hurricane Sandy relief era and reviving the economy after a significant bump during his mid-terms. On the other end, we saw Former President Donald Trump face the repercussions of controversial foreign relations, poor COVID-19 relief, and high unemployment in 2020.&#xA;With this in mind, my second blog post will focus on different independent variables that can be used to predict the outcome of the 2024 election. Specifically, I will use economic variables to analyze their predictive abilities in elections between 1948 and 2020, in order to see the variable(s) best suited to predict the election in November.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Election Blog #1: Preliminary Prediction</title>
      <link>https://example.org/note/2024/09/09/election-blog-1-preliminary-prediction/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In politics and beyond, history can be an imperative indicator of what will happen in the future. Relative to other predictive models, elections can be difficult because the sample size is small and variant. Nonetheless, voting trends can and should be used to observe national trends.&#xA;American presidential elections have historically narrowed down to the Democratic and Republican candidates&amp;rsquo; respective vote share. The graph above highlights the competitive elections that have taken place between 1948 and 2020 in the United States. The competitive nature of these elections shows promise to our strong democratic systems. They also indicate the importance of using past elections to predict future ones.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XMin&lt;/strong&gt; is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the  &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blogdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal. In fact, this theme does not contain any JavaScript code at all, although on this example website I did introduce some JavaScript code (still relatively simple anyway). The theme does not contain any images, either, and is pretty much a plain-text theme.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
