# 2024 Election Analytics Prediction Blog

## By Shivali Korgaonkar

Welcome to my personal blog for GOV 1347 with Professor Ryan Enos! This Fall, I will be tracking the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and President Donald J. Trump. Feel free to peruse my blogs, where I track important election variables, in order to build my own prediction model.
