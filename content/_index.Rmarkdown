## 2024 Election Prediction Blog

Welcome to my blog predicting and analyzing the 2024 Presidential Election! Beginning two months before Election Day, I track historical and existing trends to create the best prediction model, using variables such as demographics, the economy, polls, incumbency, and more.

This blog was an ongoing project for GOV 1347: Election Analytics. Special shoutout to Professor Ryan Enos and Matthew Dardet for their ongoing assistance and support.
