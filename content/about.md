I am a student at Harvard College ('26) studying Government with a Data Science track, and a secondary in Educational Studies. I am originally from New York City, and attended Stuyvesant High School, where I played an active role in my student government and the NYC Department of Education.

This blog was a semester-long project for GOV 1367: Election Analytics that I took my Junior year of college. With two previous years of foundational knowledge, I completed this project in R.
